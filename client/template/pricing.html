                <h4>How do your three meal plans work?</h4>
                <p> We offer three meal plans for parents and caregivers. Our Small Box Plan is great for solid food beginners. You will receive seven 4oz jars of seasonal flavors each week, and each 4oz jar may offer your little one 2-3 servings per day. We customize your menu based on your baby’s age and dietary preferences (which you can change or update at any time).

                <br>With our Medium Box Plan, you will receive fourteen 4oz jars of seasonal flavors every week. This meal plan is suitable for 8 month to 10 month old babies who need more serving sizes per day.
                Our Big Box Plan is perfect for babies older than 10 months or busy families. You will receive twenty-one 4oz jars of seasonal flavors per week. Usually many babies at 10 months old will begin to eat 4oz per meal, 3 meals a day.
                If your baby is more experienced with solid foods, you can blend our products with breast milk, formula, or infant cereals.

                <h4>How do I heat my baby food?</h4>
                <p>
                  Thaw your baby food in the refrigerator overnight. Once thawed, you can transfer to a microwave-safe bowl and heat for approximately 30 seconds - 1 minute or heat gently on the stovetop. Be sure to stir and test before serving to ensure that there are no hot spots.

If you have any questions or concerns about your baby’s allergies, please consult your pediatrician or nutritionist.
